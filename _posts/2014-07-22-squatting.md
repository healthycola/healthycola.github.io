I've been doing the <a href="http://stronglifts.com/5x5/" target="_blank">SL 5x5</a> for a few weeks now and I'm really enjoying it (especially since it's Ramadan right now).

I've struggled with getting my squats perfect and often feel like I'm straining my lower back when performing them, which can be very dangerous in the long run. That being said, today I found a really great video that shows how to do lower bar squats safely.

As of today, my weights are as follows (all 5 rep in lbs):
Squats: 155
Bench: 155
Barbell Row: 115
Overhead Press: 80
DeadLift: 125

I've been feeling stronger too, so I really hope this regime is a good path for me.
