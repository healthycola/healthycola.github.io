Hi there. On this website, I keep a journal of sorts, talk about projects I am working on or am thinking about, and anything that really tickles my fancy.

I'm a new grad from the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) and have only started working full time very recently. I enjoy developing silly, funky projects for fun and this blog is mainly an excuse for me to practice my communication skills.

I'm currently using the default [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme but should be modifying it so that it has its own personality in the near future. This site is hosted via the kind people of [GitHubIO](http://github.io).
