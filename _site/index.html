        <p>There was a fun little challenge on Reddit that I decided to partake in. I’m going to copy the challenge from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2b21mp/7182014_challenge_171_hard_intergalatic_bitstream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;">there</a> for completion.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/fitness/powerlifting/weightlifting/2014/07/22/squatting/">Squatting!</a><br>
        I've been doing the <a href="http://stronglifts.com/5x5/" target="_blank">SL 5x5</a> for a few weeks now and I'm really enjoying it (especially since it's Ramadan right now). </p>

I've struggled with getting my squats perfect and often feel like I'm straining my lower back when performing them, which can be very dangerous in the long run. That being said, today I found a really great video that shows how to do lower bar squats safely.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFHgVN_pcg&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</p>

As of today, my weights are as follows (all 5 rep in lbs):
Squats: 155
Bench: 155
Barbell Row: 115
Overhead Press: 80
DeadLift: 125</p>

I've been feeling stronger too, so I really hope this regime is a good path for me.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/c++/trie/2014/07/22/autocomplete-word-predictor-simple-trie/">Autocomplete / Word Predictor / Simple Trie</a><br>
        Decided to code up a Simple Trie for kicks. The code is still in the works, but can be accessed on git <a href="https://github.com/healthycola/SimpleWordPredictor/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

I had never coded something of nature before, so this was a fun exercise in recursion. A description of a Trie was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank">wiki</a>, but I found the description described in <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tildeAlgDS/Tree/Trie/" target="_blank">this</a> site more comprehensible.</p>
<blockquote>
A trie (from retrieval), is a multi-way tree structure useful for storing strings over an alphabet. It has been used to store large dictionaries of English (say) words in spelling-checking programs and in natural-language "understanding" programs.</p>
</blockquote>

        <a class="post-link" href="/c++/2014/07/16/2d-matrix-rotator/">2D Matrix Rotator</a><br>
        Simple challenge was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/29i9jw/6302014_challenge_169_easy_90_degree_2d_array/">posted</a> up on reddit.</p>

There was a really simple solution to it which would perform the task with O(n<sup>2</sup>) space and O(n<sup>2</sup>) time. It would involve creating a new array with the same dimensions as the original matrix, and copying the values into their new spots.</p>

I wanted to do better than this solution and thought of an onion-method to do it. It would include starting with the outside layer of the matrix, and switching the numbers with their new spots for the four sides. For instance, if the following was the matrix:
<code>
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
|  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
|  9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |
|  13 |  14 |  15 |  16 |
</code>
In the first layer, for the first iteration, 1 would move to 4s position, 4 would move to 16, 16 would move to 13s position, and 13 would move to 1s position. Iterating through all n - 1 numbers of the layer, (i.e. 1 to 3), the outer layer would have been rotated. Moving down inwards in similar fashion will have switched the entire matrix.

        <a class="post-link" href="/c++/2014/07/14/simple-rummychecker/">Simple RummyChecker</a><br>
        This is a build up on the BlackJack Checker. The Rummy Checker challenge is also from Reddit and can be found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2a9u0a/792014_challenge_170_intermediate_rummy_checker/">here</a>. I think it's more organized than the blackjack checker and less hacky (except for the Run checker function - this function is soooo messy. I need to fix it, urgh).</p>

Major things I'm happy about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple tokenizer - It's just good to have this code. I think it's reusable.</li>
<li>Decent organization - A Card class and a Hand class was created. I think the organization is decent, not amazing, but it's getting there.</li>
</ul>

Areas I need to improve on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rummy Run Detector - At the moment it's really brute-forcy. Gotta think of a better idea to go about it.</li>
<li>Separation - Could use better separation between input and output areas of the program, just for good coding practice.</li>
</ul>

        <a class="post-link" href="/c++/2014/07/12/11/">Simple BlackJackChecker</a><br>
        Wanted to add something very quick before heading to bed. I'm going to edit this post when I wake up. Here's my first take on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/29zut0/772014_challenge_170_easy_blackjack_checker/" title="Reddit's simple blackjack checker">Reddit's simple blackjack checker</a>. Seems to work, and I think it's fairly elegant, tbh, but I'll have a better look when it's not 6 in the morning :).</p>

Edit: I was reading the code again today. Some of the things I would change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spit the work into input phase and output phase. In input phase, simply store the strings. I feel like that's probably good programming practice.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of lines in main, although there are that many. Split the different areas into functions.</li>
<li>Add more objected orientedness to make this more tidy. It's a little bit messy right now.</li>
</ul>

        <a class="post-link" href="/c++/2014/07/11/vector-vs-arrays/">Vector vs. Arrays</a><br>
        <p>There aren't a whole lot of differences between Vectors and Arrays internally (i.e. in terms of performance). Vectors use an array structure internally but have additional functions to manage it. Some advantages of a vector are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can dynamically allocate vectors without knowing the exact size at the time of conception. This means that handling vectors will be safer in the long run. You need not be extra careful to exceed the boundaries of a vector. Vectors require more space however. If you want to add to a vector, and the vector is at capacity, it will double its capacity and copy all the contents. This will increase memory usage but improve flexibility</li>
<li>Vectors have additional functionality such as <code>size</code> and <code>capacity</code> which are very useful.</li>
<li>Here is a great <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6462985/c-stl-vector-vs-array-in-the-real-world">response</a> I found on StackOverflow to this:
<blockquote><p>One of the best reasons to use a vector as opposed to an array is the RAII idiom. Basically, in order for c++ code to be exception-safe, any dynamically allocated memory or other resources should be encapsulated within objects. These objects should have destructors that free these resources.</p>
<p>When an exception goes unhandled, the ONLY things that are gaurenteed to be called are the destructors of objects on the stack. If you dynamically allocate memory outside of an object, and an uncaught exception is thrown somewhere before it is deleted, you have a memory leak.</p>
<p>It's also a nice way to avoid having to remember to use delete.</p></blockquote>

</ul>
